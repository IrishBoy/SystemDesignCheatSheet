# Relational Database

Highlight: Excellent for structured data and complex queries, ensuring data integrity.

Use Cases: Ideal for banking, CRM, and any scenario requiring strong [[ACID]]compliance.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

# NoSQL Database

Highlight: Great for scalability and flexibility with unstructured data.

Use Cases: Suitable for big data analytics, real-time web apps, and content management.

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

# NewSQL Database

Highlight: Combines traditional RDBMS [[ACID]] compliance with the scalability of NoSQL.

Use Cases: Best for applications needing high transaction rates along with strong consistency, like financial trading platforms and high-speed retail systems.

Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, VoltDB.

# Document-Oriented Database

Highlight: Stores data in document formats, offering schema flexibility.

Use Cases: Best for content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications requiring frequent updates to the data structure.

Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Amazon DocumentDB.

# Key-Value Database

Highlight: Simple, efficient, and designed for high-speed read and write operations.

Use Cases: Session management, caching, and scenarios where quick lookups are critical.

Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, Etcd.

# Column-Oriented Database

Highlight: Optimized for reading and writing data in columns, enhancing analytics and query performance.

Use Cases: Big data processing, real-time analytics, and data warehousing.

Examples: Cassandra, HBase, Google Bigtable.

# Object-Oriented Database

Highlight: Aligns closely with object-oriented programming concepts, storing data as objects.

Use Cases: Complex data models like CAD systems, AI applications, and simulation systems.

Examples: db4o, ObjectDB, Versant.

# Time-Series Database

Highlight: Specialized in handling time-stamped data, efficient in querying time-based data.

Use Cases: IoT applications, financial services, and monitoring systems.

Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Kdb+.

# Wide-Column Store

Highlight: Combines elements of relational and NoSQL, efficient for storing large volumes of data.

- Data warehousing, big data processing, and real-time analytics.

Examples: Cassandra, Google Bigtable.

# Spatial Database

Highlight: Specialized in storing and querying spatial information like maps and geographic locations.

- Ideal for geographic information systems (GIS), location-based services, and environmental modeling.

Examples: PostGIS (extension for PostgreSQL), Oracle Spatial

# Graph Database

Highlight: Optimized for storing and navigating complex relationships between data points.

Use Cases: Social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.

Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, OrientDB.

# in-Memory Database

Highlight: Stores data in the main memory (RAM) for faster processing speeds.

Use Cases: High-performance applications like telecommunications, gaming, and real-time analytics.

Examples: Redis, MemSQL.
