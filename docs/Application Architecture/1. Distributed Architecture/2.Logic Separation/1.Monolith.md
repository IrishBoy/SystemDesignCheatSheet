When you start creating any application, you should not make it difficult. You need to make it work right now, so you start writing code put everything into one application. 

Bravo !

You have just created a Monolithic Architecture.

How?

Well, before going deeper into monolith let's define what is it ?


![[Monolith.png]]



The most basic and strict characteristics of a monolith architecture may be squeezed down to the following points
- Single executable program
- Single instance
- One database (we talk about one database of each [[0. 12 Database types|type]])
- Unified Build and Deployment
- Communication within application

Is it a good or a bad approach?

This question is not right. Each approach has its own pros and cons, so let's list them

Moreover, when a program does not fail, but just gives wrong results, you may face a vast array of difficulties trying to figure out part of the system, where it started to fail as everything is messed up and tightly coupled |

Moreover, when we talk about architecture and programming, it is vital to get into understanding two following things

[[1. Cohesion and Coupeling|Cohesion and Coupling]]

Why?

Because usually bad monoliths are ones that have low cohesion, which led at some moment to appearing of new architecture styles that we will discuss in the following parts.

For now we will stop here, however, later in more detailed version (so, when I have time), we will dive deeper into monolith and its types
