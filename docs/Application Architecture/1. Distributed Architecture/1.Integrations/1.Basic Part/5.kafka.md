So, what are partitions, topics, producer, consumer and consumer groups ?

- **Producer** - services that publishes messages to the broker
- **Topic** - category, or folder, or any analogy you can come up with, it is more logical unit that helps us to separate messages
- **Partitions** - every topic may be distributed across different nodes, those distributed units are called partitions
- **Consumer** and consumer group - those are services that are going to consume messages, the main difference is 

>  **If two consumers have subscribed to the same topic and are present in the same consumer group, then these two consumers would be assigned a different set of partitions and none of these two consumers would receive the same messages.**
