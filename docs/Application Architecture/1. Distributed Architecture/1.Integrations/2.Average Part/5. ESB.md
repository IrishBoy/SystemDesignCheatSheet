Enterprise Service Bus - a huge thing for huge systems

Basically it is the mechanism to keep all the components on the same side regarding the data
Meaning that this is a mechanism to support real live data exchange between all the applications inside the system 

It is vital to say, that it is **not a technology** it is a **pattern**, this means that ESB can be implemented via endless array of different technologies.

So, let's draw (obviously I've stolen this picture from some article)
![[ESB.png]]
Here it is shown that different systems use ESB in order to get and send data across all other services.
**It is vital to state that this approach should only be used when the system may be called big and you have an enormous amount of data**

# How you can implement it ?

- [[4.Pub-sub vs message queue| Message broker]] that supports fan out principles 
- A set of services that pulls and updates the data from each service to each service
- etc
# What technologies to look at ?
- Apache Camel
- WSO2 Enterprise Integrator
- MuleSoft Anypoint Platform
- Talend ESB
